# Volume Analysis and Market Trends

## About the Dataset
This dataset contains historical Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close prices, and Volume for all current components of the S&P500 index. The data is updated daily using the Yahoo Finance API.

## Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze trading volume trends and their relation to stock price movements. I will use Pandas for data manipulation and DuckDB for efficient querying and storage.

## Key Assumptions
- **Dataset Accuracy:** The dataset is clean and contains no significant errors.
- **Representation:** The stock price data accurately reflects the historical performance of the S&P 500 components.
- **Volume Significance:** Trading volume can be a significant indicator of market trends and price movements.
- **Data Completeness:** The data covers all relevant time periods without significant gaps.
- **Market Efficiency:** The market reacts efficiently to changes in trading volume and stock prices.

### Context for Key Assumptions

In the context of this analysis, I assume that trading volume and stock price data from the S&P 500 are reliable indicators of market behavior. Similar to how sales managers use data to track performance and make strategic decisions, our analysis aims to:

- **Track Volume Trends:** Understand how trading volume changes over time and its relation to stock prices.
- **Identify High-Volume Periods:** Detect periods with unusual trading activity that might indicate significant market events.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigate the correlation betIen trading volume and stock price changes to derive actionable insights.
- **Market Conditions:** Analyze how trading volumes vary during market uptrends and downtrends to better understand market dynamics.
